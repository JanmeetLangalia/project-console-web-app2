            <h2> VS Console Screen:</h2>
            <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary
         interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used
         for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered 
                  a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more
                   servers.It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output
                    and the keyboard is used for input. ... Modern consoles often provide a graphical
                     interface that can be used to control machines on a local network (LAN) or 
                     provide remote access to remote systems.You should use the console. log()
                      method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log
                       function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript
                        print the output to the console. To open the browser console,
       right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
